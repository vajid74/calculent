# Calculent distribution folders

The `dist` folder includes the ready-to-use theme and plugin directories:

- `calculent-child/` — Astra child theme for upload via SFTP or manual packaging.
- `calculent-logic/` — plugin folder for upload via SFTP or manual packaging.

If you need a zip archive, run `./scripts/package.sh` locally to generate one from these folders.
